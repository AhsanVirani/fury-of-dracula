1) Where to start?
	Check where Hunters are and start at unusual position, far away, but near sea i.e. port. Place vampire and secure it by traps.
- Remember to secure vampire as it matures 6th round -> so -13 equals 13 rounds point deduction, which is Huge. Only move far when multiple Hunters
	approaching and risk of death is high.
- As Hunters move away from CD, go there and get points. Make use of HI and DB.
- Staying near Sea will help to not get caught. Also, easy route to CD in case short of points

2) Encounters?
	When a Hunter is alone and his health is <= 4, Kill him. 
-	Otherwise, maintain hidden position and no need for encounter.
-  In case of surrounded by Hunters, run out of moves and Teleport to CASTLE_DRACULA.

3) Every 6th Round when time to Place Vampire
	- Make sure to get as far from Hunters at 6th Round, so Vampire is placed at well secured Location. Follow this up by multiple traps, and Dracula safeguarding,
	unless too many Hunters come to rescue.
